## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this challenge as an opportunity to continue practicing css and accessibility. For accessibility, I did my best, but there's still the issue that as with a lot of these designs, the color contrast is not great and does not meet WCAG standard. 

### Continued development

Continue practicing CSS and making my pages accessible.
